### voidfinder

This algorithm identifies spherical underdensities in a cosmological volume. It works on periodic cosmological simulations, as well as on observational galaxy surveys. Examples of its application in astronomy research can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02864 or https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00101.

### Installation:

Under the main directory, compile the package with `python setup.py build`, and then install it with `python setup.py install`.

Requirements: 
  - `Python` >= 3.0.0
  - `GCC` >= 4.2.1
  - `Scipy` >= 1.5.0

Earlier versions of those software packages might work as well, but they have not been tested.
